Small command line tool to work with GraphIT.

* Installation
  Download and install the ~.rpm~ packages from the [[../../releases][releases page]] of this repository. There are some dependencies that require
  the “Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux”
  (https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) repository to be active:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
yum install epel-release # if necessary
yum localinstall graphit-tool-x.x-x.noarch.rpm
#+END_SRC

* Setup
** Setup WSO2 Service Provider and Policies
   In order for ~graphit-tool~ to be able to access the Graph
   Database, a Service Provider has to be created and an access policy
   has to be installed.

*** Creating the Service Provider
	1. Log into WSO2 and go to Main → Identity → Service Providers → Add

	2. As Service Provider Name, fill in “graphit-tool”
       (exactly like that), the Description doesn’t matter. Click on
       “Register”

	   [[file:img/add_service_provider.png]]

	3. Open “Inbound Authentication Configuration” → “OAuth/OpenID
       Connect Configuration” and click on “Configure”.

	   #+ATTR_ASCIIDOC: :width 600 :align center
	   [[file:img/conf_service_provider.png]]

	4. Uncheck everything but “Client Credentials” and click “Add”.

	   #+ATTR_ASCIIDOC: :width 600 :align center
	   [[file:img/auth_settings.png]]

	5. Click on “Show” and copy the client key and the client
       secret. You’ll need them later in the configuration:

	   #+ATTR_ASCIIDOC: :width 600 :align center
	   [[file:img/credentials.png]]

	6. Click on “Update”

*** Adding the co.arago.GraphIT-allow-All-graphit-tool policy
	IMPORTANT: This step is always necessary as it grants graphit-tool
	access to the Graph Database. Without this policy, graphit-tool
	will not be able to write to the Graph Database.

	The policy can be downloaded here: [[policies/co.arago.GraphIT-allow-All-graphit-tool.xml]]

	1. Go to Main → Entitlement → PAP → Policy Administration

	2. Click on “Add New Entitlement Policy” and select “Import
       Existing Policy”.

	3. Select the ~co.arago.GraphIT-allow-All-graphit-tool.xml~ file
       and click on “Upload”.

	4. Back in the policy list, publish the new
       “co.arago.GraphIT-allow-All-graphit-tool” policy by clicking on
       “Publish to My PDP” and then on “Publish”.
** Copying the Graphit-Server and WSO2 certificates
   Get ~graphit-server.pem~ and ~wso2carbon.pem~ from your HIRO
   instance's IAM and Database node (they're located at
   ~/opt/autopilot/conf/certs/~) and copy them to
   ~/usr/share/graphit-tool/~
** Configuration
   The system–wide configuration file is located at
   ~/etc/graphit-tool.conf~. User–specific settings can be stored in
   =~/.graphit-tool.conf=.

   The configuration file looks like this:
   #+BEGIN_SRC
[Graphit]
URL: https://graphit.yourdomain.com:8443
VerifyCert: /usr/share/graphit-tool/graphit-server.pem

[WSO2]
URL: https://wso2.yourdomain.com:9443
VerifyCert: /usr/share/graphit-tool/wso2carbon.pem
ClientID: GRAPHIT_TOOL_CLIENT_ID
ClientSecret: GRAPHIT_TOOL_CLIENT_SECRET

[MARS]
Schema: /usr/share/graphit-tool/MODEL_default.xsd

   The following values *must* be set:
